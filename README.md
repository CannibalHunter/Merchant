### Notes
---
- Change between currencies using the Page Up/Down keys.
- Change between categories using the Left/Right arrow keys, and between items with the Up/Down arrow keys
- Some enemies will not reward cash for killing them. Putti and Lost Souls in particular.
- Loadout code for the mercenary bucks is `bux`.
- When new items are added, `hdm_resetstore` should be used in the console to refresh the merchant's items if loading an older save.
- Escorting the merchant to the exit will give you a 20% boost to whatever money you have earned, but will also remove them from the map, meaning they will no longer be there in the case of hubs. In multiplayer games, the distance to the arbitrator (usually team leader) is taken into account, and not whoever pressed the switch.

### Known Issues
---
- Merchant can block some paths. Either push them or grab-n-drag them away.
